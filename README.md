# Hello, I'm Sujit Kumar
I'm a full stack developer with a passion for efficient workflows and powerful tools. On the development front, I work with NextJS and TypeScript for the frontend, and Node.js and FastAPI for the backend. While I’m not coding, you’ll find me writing about tech on [dev.to](https://dev.to/sujit-shrc) or exploring new ways to improve my setup.


In my work space, I rely on a carefully chosen set of tools that enhance my productivity and workflow. 
 - I use Arch Linux for its minimalistic behaviour, simplicity and laziness.
 - I prefer i3wm for its keyboard-centric efficiency.
 - Neovim is my text editor of choice due to its extensibility and modal editing capabilities.
 - while Alacritty serves as my terminal for its speed and minimalism.
 - I manage multiple terminal sessions with tmux to streamline my workflow. 
 - For a clean and informative command line, I use the Starship prompt.
 - When it comes to file navigation, yazi is my go-to terminal-based file manager.
 - For API testing, I prefer atac for managing API collections.
 > "Arch is one of my favourite linux distribution, where mostly Rust based packages and terminal are my building blocks. I break things just to fix them and call it a masterpiece."

## What I Do

- Full stack development
- Linux & Database administration
- Deployment & CI/CD pipeline construction

## What's Next?

I'm always looking to expand my toolkit. Currently, I'm interested in trying out the Zed editor, though my system's GPU limitations are holding me back for now.
